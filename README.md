# WSI Tissue Tiler

[![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/wsi-tissue-tiler)](https://pypi.org/project/wsi-tissue-tiler/) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/build-passing-brightgreen)](https://github.com/VatsalPatel18/wsi_tissue_tiler)

This Python package provides tools for efficient processing of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in the SVS format. It allows you to extract smaller tiles from large WSIs, making it easier to analyze and process these images for various tasks like tissue identification and classification.

## Features

- **Tile Extraction:** Divide large WSIs into smaller tiles of a specified size.
- **Tissue Identification (Optional):** Utilize a pre-trained model to identify and isolate tissue regions within the tiles (requires additional dependencies).

## Installation

You can install `wsi-tissue-tiler` using `pip`:

```bash
pip install wsi-tissue-tiler
```
